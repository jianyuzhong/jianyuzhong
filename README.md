Introduction
------

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Hello, Iâ€™m David. I work as a software development engineer and currently reside in Chengdu. I graduated from Chengdu University of Information Technology in 2019 with a major in Software Engineering.Over the years, I've gained extensive experience in various projects ranging from B/S backend development to data processing and web scraping. My technical breadth encompasses backend technologies such as .NET and .NET Core, frontend technologies including React, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as expertise in Python for web scraping using libraries like Pandas. I'm proficient in working with databases like Elasticsearch, SQL Server, and Redis. Delving deeper into technical realms, I'm well-versed in mainstream protocols like HTTP and TCP, with experience in packet analysis, socket-based file transfer using C#, and multimedia parsing. My business acumen allows me to independently craft requirement specifications, interface documentation, and graphical representations such as use case diagrams and data flow diagrams. Moreover, I have a strong collaborative spirit, evident in my ability to work effectively within teams. My achievements include obtaining a CET6 certification, recognition as an outstanding employee, and a demonstrated ability to enhance development tasks through efficient learning and leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT.
